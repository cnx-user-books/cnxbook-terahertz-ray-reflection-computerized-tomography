<section id="concl"><title>Conclusions</title>
<para id="id41072457">Using the terahertz reflected waveforms, we
were able to measure the projections and reconstruct the original
image. This process was completed in two steps. In the first,
inverse and Wiener filtering were used to deconvolve the data from
the reference pulse to obtain the actual projections of the test
object. In the second, the Filtered Backprojection Algorithm
featuring the Fourier Slice Theorem was used to filter the
projections using a ramp filter and backproject the result over the
image plane, thus reconstructing the image of the object.</para>
<para id="id40760043">As far as the deconvolution part of the
project concerns, the regularized inverse filter gives better
results than Wiener filtering, as already pointed out. Care should
be exercised when picking the regularized parameter Î³, so as not to
increase the noise level of the resulting signal. Usually, this is
a case-dependent procedure that takes numerical experimentation. It
should be noted that the original data at hand were of very good
quality with low noise level. Thus the results of Wiener filtering
were worse than those obtained by inverse filtering.</para>

<para id="id41072496">For the reconstruction part, it was found
that the number of projection angles used was vital to the clarity
of the final image. We were able to greatly downsample the data and
still maintain image quality to a certain point. Due to the size of
the data, the algorithms ran for minutes.</para>

<para id="id41072536">Much potential for future improvement and
implementation is possible using this method of computerized
tomography. Advanced deconvolution methods featuring wavelets for
efficient noise reduction can be used for isolating the projections
out of the measured waveforms. Furthermore, it seems reasonable to
cut-off the first part of each measured waveform since it only
contains noise and no useful information for the image
reconstruction. This can be accomplished by appropriately windowing
the raw measurements before any other manipulations takes place.
Due to the linear nature of the process, different algorithm code
could have been written to start reconstructing the image
immediately after the first projection had been calculated. This
and other efficiency tools could be implemented to greatly increase
the speed of the overall reconstruction, making the process
applicable for real-time use.</para>
